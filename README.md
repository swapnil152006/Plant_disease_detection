# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect plant diseases using deep learning techniques. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and image processing, the model identifies and classifies various plant diseases from leaf images.

## 🛠️ Features
- Image-based plant disease detection
- Deep learning model using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- User-friendly interface for predictions
